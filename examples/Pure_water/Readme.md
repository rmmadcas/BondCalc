In this example we will find the average number of hydrogen bonds per molecule in a sample of liquid water molecules. Movie1.pdb is the trajectory of water using MD with. The positions of the particles are stored every Deltat=0.05ps.

We take advantage of this fact to calculate the average lifetime of hydrogen bonds fitting by multiplying the parameter "b" that appears in the output by the Deltat.
