In this example we will find the average number of pi bonds per molecule in a sample of liquid benzene molecules. Benzene.pdb is the trajectory of benzene using MC simulations. We use this simulation to calculate the spatial distribution function (SDF) of pure benzene at 298K. This example calculate the clusters too.
